# Text To speeech converter
A type of assistive technology known as text-to-speech (TTS) reads digital text aloud. Technology sometimes referred to as "read aloud"

TTS can turn words on a computer or other digital device into audio with just a button click or a finger swipe. Children who have difficulty reading will greatly benefit from TTS. However, it can also assist children with writing, editing, and even concentration.

# How text-to-speech works 

TTS is compatible with almost all personal digital devices, including smartphones, tablets, and computers. Text files of any kind, including Word and Pages documents, can be read aloud. Pages on the internet can also be read aloud.

The voice in TTS is made by computers, and reading speed can usually be increased or decreased. The quality of the voices varies, but some sound human. Even voices created by computers that sound like children speaking exist.

Words are highlighted in many TTS tools as they are read aloud. Kids can see and hear text at the same time thanks to this.

A few TTS instruments likewise have an innovation called optical person acknowledgment (OCR). TTS tools can read text aloud from images using OCR. Your child could, for instance, take a picture of a street sign and have the words on the sign sung aloud.
